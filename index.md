## Background

I am a bioinformatician and cancer biologist, who is interested in understanding the secrets beneath several different cancers. Also, I am the one who is brave to dive into the unknown, and who loves the adventure to find something new who have not never tried.

I have been studied in South Korea and the United States. Currently I am in Belgium, as a PhD student having a role of bioinformatician and data analyst.

I have various background due to the several in-field experiences, especially population genomics, functional genomics, oncology, molecular biology and computational biology. These days, I am mainly interested in understanding the mechanism of cancer genomic landscape and connecting it to the cancer treatment. 

My ultimate goal of studying bioinformatics and cancer biology is finding the new way to save more people who are fighting with the various types of cancer. In other words, my goal to study is bringing back the happier life for the patients and their family, with science and technology.

## Interest

*   Understanding of genomic landscape of cancers with tumour heterogeneity
*   Interpretation of chromatin and transcriptomic landscape regulating cancer mechanism
*   Development of Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) panel for cancer using genomic variations

*   Computer-aided drug design of anti-cancer medicine
*   Drug development of anti-cancer treatment having less side-effect or resistance

*   Population genomics for the cancers with rare occurrance
