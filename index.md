## Background

- Born in South Korea and studied in Korea and USA.
- Currently in Bruxelles, as a PhD student in laboratory of cancer and Stem cells
- Half wet-lab and half dried lab but decided to concentrate on computational biology
- Population genomics > cancer biology > bioinformatician who is willing to reveal the genomic landscape underneath cancer
- Brave to dive into new world
- Music and crossfit besides

## Interest

*   Understanding of genomic landscape underneath squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)
*   Interpretation of chromatin and transcriptomic landscape regulating cancer mechanism
*   Development of Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) panel for colorectal cancer

*   Computer-aided drug design of anti-cancer reagent
*   Drug development of anti-allergy reagent

*   Population genomics for Tourette's syndrome
